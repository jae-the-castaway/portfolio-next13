            Walking is one of my favorite hobby. in fact, I loved it so much
            that we decided to move to Chicago and even sold our car since I
            didn't really need it anymore.
          </p>
          <p className=" mb-4 text-xl text-gray-500">
            It's a great way to stay active and healthy. But beyond the physical
            benefits, I also love walking beacause it allows me to explore my
            city in a way that I never could when I was driving. I feel like I'm
            doing my part to contribute to a more sustainable and livable city
            by choosing to walk instead of drive whenever possible.

            Did you know South Korea is covered by mountains by 70%? It's a
            great country to go hiking with beautiful four seasons.

          <p className=" mb-4 text-xl text-gray-500">
            I make sure to hit the trails at least once a month, with a

            As an avide gamer, I'm always on the lookout for new titles that
            offer engaging gameplay and interesting storylines. While I enjoy
            many different types of games.

            I'm also a discerning critic who appreiciate effort and creativity
            that goes into making games. I also appreciate games that offer
            unique or innovative mechanics, and that push the boundaries of
            what's possible within the medium.
